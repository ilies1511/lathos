# Git Wokrflow:

## Always Work in Your Own Branch - Never Push Directly to Master
1. git checkout -b IntraName_TypeOfBranch --> z.B iziane_fix/parser
2. only push here

## You have worked on your branch and now want to merge it into the master branch

1. git checkout master
2. git pull origin master
3. git merge feature-branch
    1. if merge conflicts appear, solve with concerned member
4. git push origin master


## Context: (mostly after you merged your branch with master, you do the following) —> Get your Branch up to date (after peers added feature)

1. go to branch

    ```bash
    git checkout <name of feature branch>
    ```

2. git fetch origin
3. git merge origin/master
    1. if merge conflicts appear, solve with concern member
